                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-secondary mb-4">I've seen other places advertise LASIK at discount prices. Why should I choose EyeSTAR LASIK Institute?</h3>
                        <div class="text-base text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                            <p>Most of those places are in fact agents, usually one person who create a website overnight and pose as clinics or hospitals. We strongly encourage you to choose a clinic or hospital directly, instead of dealing with such agents, who scam tourists or take them to the clinic that offers them the most commission.</p>
                            <p>With some LASIK clinics and hospitals, a lower price for LASIK treatment comes at the expense of patient care or surgical experience. In other words, you get what you pay for. Our surgeons select our LASIK patients carefully and provide them with the best care possible, from initial consultation to post-procedure visits. Our surgeons' standards for success are higher than most LASIK surgeons: more than 99% of our patients see 20/20 or 20/25 following LASIK. The industry standard for success is 20/40 or better.</p>
                            <p>"Bargain basement" fees on LASIK sometimes do not include medications, temporary prescription glasses, postoperative care after 3 months, enhancement procedures, the option to have one-eye done at a time, and so on. Many of the discount centers work like assembly lines where the patient-doctor relationships are minimal. Often, discount centers do not allow you to choose your surgeon or the doctor that performs your pre- and post-operative care. For most people, refractive surgery isn't the most appropriate place to try to get a "good deal". You can throw away and replace bad glasses or contact lenses, but you can't do that with a bad refractive surgery. Look for quality, service, and commitment.</p>
                            <p>Low-cost providers usually cut costs by using blades multiple times. Some centers don't even sterilize them between patients. At such discount centers, there is even the risk of contagious diseases such as hepatitis or AIDS. One of the more important steps to avoid complication is in the rigorous testing of our patients. After the brief initial screening exam and prior to undergoing a procedure, we will perform a most thorough evaluation; some important measurements will be performed two or more times, and will be further repeated if necessary. At the EyeSTAR LASIK Institute, we will only perform LASIK operation on you if we believe that we can obtain a very good result. By far the most common complication is under-correction or over-correction. In the case of an under-correction or over-correction, the vision will be dramatically better, but a small amount of focusing error still remains. Further laser treatment, known as an "enhancement" or a "touch-up", can then be used to improve the vision further by decreasing the remaining nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism. There is no additional fee for "enhancement" procedures, which are performed on only 0.5% of our patients.</p>

                            <p>In many instances, the more you pay the better quality care and service you get. LASIK treatment is a professional service with variable quality. Contrary to some advertising, it is not a product with consistency from one place to another. Top surgeons and optometrists have professional fees consummate with their expertise. Often, less-skilled doctors charge less in order to attract more patients. However, this does not necessarily mean the most expensive provider will always give you the best quality care and service.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-secondary mb-4">How long has this technology been around?</h3>
                        <div class="text-base text-gray-700 space-y-4">
                            <p>Reshaping the cornea for the correction of refractive errors has been known since the mid-1800s. But a practically beneficial operation goes back to 1949. This old technique called keratophakia is similar to a permanent contact lens. This procedure consists of taking away a layer of a donor cornea, sculpting it and putting it on the patient's cornea to correct it. It was done by stitches and from materials of donor corneas at that time. In 1963 Barraquer invented a carpenter's plane-like device called microkeratome. Then laserless LASIK-like operations have been performed.</p>
                            <p>The first working Excimer laser (which was created by Stuart Searles (IBM) to etch circuits into computer chips without melting the silicon) was available on earth in 1975. Later this laser was tested by the US military on many materials even on the cornea. As far as we know, Trokel is the first doctor to notice the potential of this new laser for the correction of refractive errors and he began animal studies of Excimer laser in 1983. But the honor to use it the first time on humans goes to Theo Seiler, MD in April 1985. But routine PRK for myopia has started in 1987, and turned to LASIK with stitches and free cap in 1989 by Buratto and today's LASIK by Guimaraes in 1991. Interestingly LASIK's patent has been issued to Gholam Payman in 1989 (patent application in 1985 from animal studies).</p>

                            <p>As people add candles to their birthday cakes, at about the age of 40, the natural autofocusing lens of the eye begins to lose its autofocus capability. This is when reading glasses appear or nearsighted people start lifting their glasses in order to see up close. When LASIK operation removes a nearsighted person's nearsightedness, they will shortly if not immediately see better in the distance for the first time and will need help for seeing up close at some point after the age of 40, like the rest of normal vision people over forty. The only exception to this is "monovision," an unnatural condition where one eye is purposely left slightly nearsighted. Some people can "switch eyes" according to whether they are looking at distance or reading up close. Those who can accomplish this task enjoy monovision and carry a pair of compensating spectacles with them for times when they need both eyes working together. If you are over 40, to know if you are a monovision candidate, we recommend a contact lens trial of monovision to simulate the condition.</p>

                            <p>People over the age of forty may need two separate prescriptions to see clearly, one for the distance and a different one for reading. The only options for Laser Vision Correction are to either correct both eyes for good distance vision and wear reading glasses or to elect monovision correction. In monovision correction, your dominant eye is corrected for distance vision and your non dominant eye is corrected for reading or intermediate vision. Monovision does not work for everyone, and it is always best to try it with contact lenses before doing it surgically. If it does work, it usually allows that person to function at most times without glasses for most distances, although some patients will want "night driving" glasses, "sewing glasses", and many will eventually have to wear some reading glasses as they continue to age.</p>

                            <p>Refractive surgery is highly technologically driven. Just like in the computer industry, there are constant advancements. The important question is whether the technological advances translate into proportionate increases in patient satisfaction. Because the level of patient satisfaction with modern refractive surgery is already so high, there probably will not be dramatic advances in the satisfaction for most patients. In many cases, time spent waiting for the technological improvements also means less time to potentially benefit from the refractive surgery. However, a few patients should wait for more advanced technologies and we will advise you whether you fall into this category.</p>

With any large deviations, the surgeon or the eye tracker will simply stop the laser ablation and restart the process when the eye is perfectly aligned. The laser is designed to pick up where it left off. Although eye movement is a concern of many patients, those who have experienced the LASIK laser vision correction procedure rarely note a problem maintaining fixation throughout the short laser ablation.</p>

EyeSTAR results indicate that, post-procedure, we have never had a patient request pain medication. Our patients tell us that they are so well prepared by our clinic's staff before the procedure that any fear, anxiety and concerns were gone!

Right after the procedure you see as if looking behind water. In about 4 hours the vision will be clearer. While your eyes are healing, it is normal for your vision to go back and forth between clear and blurry phases for several weeks. However, vision can continue to improve, and best vision can still take two to three months to occur, particularly with higher prescriptions. If necessary, adjustments to the surgery called enhancements can be done. Patients who undergo hyperopic LASIK often need to wait longer to able to see clearly. Typically, they are unable to see with intense clarity for one or two weeks, with best vision coming in several months post-operatively.</p>

                            <p>It is possible to have an enhancement after the initial procedure if the doctor deems it necessary and beneficial to the patient. Should an enhancement be necessary, it will be performed at no charge to the patient after six months following the procedure. Sometimes for very high prescriptions our surgeons purposefully divide the treatment into two sessions.

                            <p>Although the vast majority of our patients will achieve excellent vision without glasses or contacts, a few will have a small residual refractive error, leaving them still slightly nearsighted or farsighted. Most of these patients can see fine for most of their daily activities, and use a thin pair of glasses for such tasks as nighttime driving. If you would like this residual refractive error corrected, an enhancement laser procedure can be performed after six months. The enhancement rate in our practice is 0.5%. Our doctors will weigh the probable benefits, patient expectations, and potential risks when determining whether an enhancement is appropriate.
                            Typically, patients considered for an enhancement procedure should have at least 1.00 diopter of residual hyperopia, myopia or astigmatism or unaided vision of 20/40 or worse.

With an enhancement, the flap is simply lifted back to allow the laser beam to remove a little more tissue. Then the flap is gently smoothed back into place again. Although retreatment may further improve your ability to see, perfect vision is still impossible to guarantee.</p>

                            <p>The safety of LASIK operation is one of the main reasons it has become so popular. Severe complications are extremely rare. The complication rate and the infection rate from LASIK are much less than those with contact lens wear. The laser has been in widespread use for the treatment of myopia (nearsightedness) and astigmatism over 15 years. Millions of successful procedures have been performed around the world. When performed by the proper surgeon, LASIK treatments are extremely safe. Although no procedure is without risks, these risks are minimal. The complication rate is much lower when the treatment is performed by corneal specialists who are very experienced in LASIK, as our surgeons are. Here is what the TIME magazine (November 1,1999) has stated: "Estimates of post-LASIK complication rates range from less than 1% of patients of corneal specialists to as high as 5% of patients of less experienced ophthalmologists".</p>
                            <p>When you are interviewing doctors and you ask about their complication rates and you hear the answer "none", walk away. Quoting Dr. Machat: "If doctors say they have never had a complication, they either don't do surgery or they are lying."</p>
                            <p>In order to decrease the risk of complication, we at the EyeSTAR LASIK Institute, Istanbul, Turkey take many steps that go far beyond the minimum standards of most laser centers. Our laser is calibrated before every single procedure to ensure the most accurate results, whereas many laser centers only calibrate the laser every six patients, or even just once per day. We monitor and control the temperature and humidity in our laser room strictly, which improves the accuracy of our results. Reputable centers like ours use one microkeratome blade per patient to avoid infection and potential flap complications from a damaged or progressively dulled blade. The risk of both problems increases significantly the more times the blade is used. Some excimer laser patients will experience optical aberrations during the initial healing phases, including glare, halos at night, or ghost images. This will disappear within several weeks. Careful attention to detail in centration and calibration of the laser, as well as measurement of pupil size, substantially lessens the incidence of optical aberrations.</p>
